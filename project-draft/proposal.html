        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Looking for the perfect art piece for your home that would suit your budget,
          art style, artist preference, and location can be daunting and hard to navigate.
          We plan to make a web app that allows for art buyers to browse and search for
          the kind of art that they are looking for. We want buyers to be able to search
          for different kinds of artists and also browse through an online gallery. This
          will allow for many smaller artists to gain exposure and possibly help them
          sell their pieces. While looking at art pieces, the shoppers can look at an artist
          profile and also get connected with the artist. This will hopefully create a stronger
          art community. <a href="https://www.artfinder.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAoL6eBhA3EiwAXDom5omEF91blDRMp0RMQAbxaCCuvF88NnPK2y84ePnr-DojhsfDUw7akRoCOKIQAvD_BwE#/">Art finders</a>
          already exist, but our plan is to create stronger relationships within the art community
          instead of an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">"amazon for art"</a>. We want artists
          have a connection with buyers and potentially see an artist profile, and where buyers
           can support them and see their work.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
          The users of this web application are locals and will enable them to expose themselves to try different
          art types by artists within their community. This app will impact the local art community by giving them
            a platform to showcase their art to the broader community. By having the categorization option, local
            have the chance to discover small businesses or local artist to supports to may provide pieces that they
            may identify with based on race/ethnicity/religion etc. Additionally, this app offers art options based
            on medium (acrylics, paints etc.) if patron locals have preferences on art type they particularly want
            to view or buy.
        </p>
        <p>The users will be able to find artist by specific types, location, and culture. They will
          be able to filter and interact with their results based on price additionally. They will be
          able to find pertinent artist information, like where to find their website, where to submit
          commissions, and where to support that artist. The users will be able to easily find
          indigenous and more culturally specific artists for their tastes.
        <ul>
          <li>a button for price range ($, $$, $$$, $$$$)</li>
          <li>a drop down menu for art types (paintings, animations, illustrations, sculptures, knitted/croqcheted pieces, culturally specific crafts)</li>
          <li>a feature that tells you where this artâ€™s work is available (online, physical location, museum, gallery)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The information the user will be viewing will be fake data about the types of art local to the United States
          and is able to filter to the desired State and City.
        </p>
        <p>A web application that helps art enthusiasts find the perfect art piece with a specific price point/budget
          in mind where users can also find art based on their preferences like art type (Ex: painting, poster). This web
          application gives users the ability to find art that works with their budget which is particularly helpful for
          users that are low income, and we want to create a sense of community.
